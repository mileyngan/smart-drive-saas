## Complete Project Specification & Strategic Vision

---

## 1. ðŸ“Š EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**LukDrive** is a next-generation, AI-powered driving school management ecosystem designed for the Cameroonian market and engineered with global standards in mind. This platform serves as a central hub for driving school administrators, instructors, and students, streamlining every aspect of the learning journey from registration to exam readiness.

The initial implementation focuses on a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** that delivers the core, essential functionality for all user roles. This MVP is built upon a robust technical architecture and includes several key innovative featuresâ€”such as AI-powered quiz generation and advanced content securityâ€”designed to showcase the platform's unique value proposition to students, schools, and potential investors.

Beyond the MVP, LukDrive is envisioned as a comprehensive enterprise solution, incorporating advanced features like virtual driving simulation, deep business intelligence analytics, and multi-layered security protocols to become the definitive operating system for driving schools in Africa and beyond.

## 3. ðŸ‘¤ USER ROLES & CORE FEATURES (MVP IMPLEMENTATION)

The MVP provides a complete, end-to-end workflow for the four primary user roles.

### 3.1. Super Administrator

The Super Admin has oversight of the entire platform, ensuring quality control and managing the onboarding of new schools.

*   **School Approval System:**
    *   A dedicated dashboard lists all driving schools pending registration approval.
    *   The Super Admin can review school details, including their Ministry of Transport verification code.
    *   Functionality to **Approve** or **Reject** schools. Rejected schools are updated with a reason for the decision, and automated email notifications are sent to the school administrator.

### 3.2. School Administrator

The School Administrator manages all aspects of their individual driving school.

*   **Onboarding:**
    *   A public-facing registration page allows new schools to sign up.
    *   Upon approval, the school begins a 7-day free trial.
*   **Dashboard & User Management:**
    *   A central dashboard displays key metrics like total student and instructor counts.
    *   A comprehensive user management interface to **create, view, edit, and deactivate** student and instructor accounts. New users are automatically sent an email invitation with a one-time password.
*   **Course Management (Course Builder):**
    *   An intuitive, multi-step interface to **create and manage driving programs** (e.g., Novice, Accelerated).
    *   Functionality to add individual chapters to each program, including uploading **eBook (PDF)** and **video (MP4)** content via a dedicated file upload service.
*   **AI Quiz Generation:**
    *   For each chapter, the admin can click **"Generate Quiz"** to use AI to create a set of questions based on the uploaded eBook content.
    *   The admin is then presented with a **Quiz Editor**, allowing them to **review, edit, add, or delete questions** before saving the final quiz to the platform.

### 3.3. Instructor

Instructors are responsible for tracking and managing the progress of their assigned students.

*   **Dashboard:**
    *   The instructor's dashboard displays a list of **only the students specifically assigned to them**.
*   **Student File Management:**
    *   Instructors can view a detailed, chapter-by-chapter progress file for each student.
    *   This view shows the student's status on eBook/video completion and their quiz scores.
    *   The interface allows the instructor to **mark practical tasks as complete** and **add or edit instructor notes** for each chapter, with all changes saved in real-time.

### 3.4. Student

The student is at the center of the learning experience, with an interactive and secure interface.

*   **Dashboard & Program View:**
    *   A personalized dashboard shows the student's overall progress in their enrolled program.
    *   The program view displays all chapters in a sequential list.
*   **Sequential Unlocking System:**
    *   A chapter is only unlocked when the *previous* chapter's requirements are met: **the quiz must be passed (â‰¥80%) AND the practical tasks must be marked as complete by an instructor.**
*   **Learning Interface:**
    *   For each unlocked chapter, the student can access the **eBook content** and **video lesson**.
    *   A fully functional **Quiz Interface** with a timer allows students to test their knowledge. The results are displayed immediately, and progress is saved.
*   **Advanced Content Security (DRM):**
    *   All learning content is wrapped in a secure container that **disables right-click, copy/paste, and printing**.
    *   The system detects if developer tools are open and will blank the screen to prevent inspection.
    *   A **simulated Camera Detection** feature is included for the presentation, displaying a "CAM-DRM ACTIVE" indicator and a toast notification to demonstrate the platform's advanced security vision.
*   **AI Chatbot Assistant:**
    *   A floating chatbot icon is available on all student pages.
    *   Students can ask questions about the Cameroonian road code, and the AI assistant, powered by GPT-3.5, will provide helpful and context-aware answers.
